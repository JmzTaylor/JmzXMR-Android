Jmz XMR - Android
=

This is highly deprecated and isn't being maintained anymore.  There are a few bugs but overall works like its supposed to.

I created this because I am a huge fan of self hosting anything and everything.  And since Monero is meant to be private, only made sense to have full control over monitoring

Features:
* Ties into my web app for monitoring XMR Rigs

Installation
=
Just open in android studio and compile
